# **Pet Adoption Portal:**

This project is almost finished, I am finishing the implementation of the last features. Below are the screenshots of some of the features.

**_Description_**
A web application designed to connect potential dog adopters with available dogs in need of a loving home. This platform allows users to browse adoptable pets, filter by breed, size, age, and place, and get detailed information about each pet and apply for adoption.
It also includes articles about different dogs breed specifications, care, how to choose a proper breed.
Admin can confirm or reject the applications from users, filter them by status, user names, date.
The application provides an easy-to-use, simple and modern interface.


**_Features_**
- User Registration & Login: Allows users to create an account and log in to use all features of the web application
- Pet Listings: Browse through a list of available dogs for adoption.
- Search & Filters: Easily find pets based on breed, size, age, and more.
- Pet Details: View detailed information about each pet, including description, health status, and adoption requirements.
- Possibility to Add new dog listing for an admin, Edit the existing one, and Delete the listings.
- Adopt a Pet: Users can express interest in adopting a pet through the portal.
- Admin pannel: admin can see applications for adoptions from users, filter the applications by status, user names, date, confirm or reject.
- Sending mails to user email adresses: after user applies for the adoption, he gets confirmation email that his application is now in progress. Once the application is rejected, or denied he gets one of the following emails: "Invitation to the shelter email", or "Information email about rejection of his application".
