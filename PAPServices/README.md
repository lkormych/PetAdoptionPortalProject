# **Pet Adoption Portal:**

This project is now in progress, therefore not all the features are yet available, but I am working on it :)

**_Description_**
A web application designed to connect potential dog adopters with available dogs in need of a loving home. This platform allows users to browse adoptable pets, filter by breed, size, age, and place, and get detailed information about each pet and apply for adoption.
It also includes articles about different dogs breed specifications, care, how to choose a proper breed.
